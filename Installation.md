# Installation

The newest release will always be found at <a href="https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/releases">github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/releases</a> here on GitHub. Look for an <code>*.oxt</code> file with a name similar to <code>OOoLilyPond-0.X.X.oxt</code> and download it:

For anyone who doesn't want to read the release notes, there's a simple <a href="https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/wiki/Downloads">Download</a> page as well.

In LibreOffice, open the extension manager (Tools -&gt; Extension Manager), click the "Add" button which will open a file dialog. Select the <code>*.oxt</code> file you've just downloaded and confirm with the "Open" button.

When asked for whom you want to install the extension, you can choose "only for me" which won't require administrator privileges on your system. After successful installing, close the extension manager, and probably you will be requested to restart LibreOffice.

Now LibreOffice will have a new "OLy" toolbar. It contains a single "OLy" button that launches the extension.
