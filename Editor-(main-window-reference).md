# Editor (main window reference)

### Text editor

The white editor pane at the top offers a simple text editor.

Below the editor pane there are two buttons that support the use of an external code editor (see [Easier editing](https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/wiki/Introduction#easier-editing)):

### Open as temp. file in Ext. Editor
saves the current code into a temporary file which is then opened in the external editor.

### Import from temp. file
re-imports the contents of the same file back into OLy's editor.

### Default Code
This checkbox shows if the editor still shows the unchanged default code from the selected template. The mark is removed once you apply any change to the code. 
When clicking on the checkbox, you will be asked if you want to reset your code to the template's default code. Be careful: If you confirm now, your changes will be lost. 

### Template
This dropdown box lets you choose a template on which your snippet will be based. 

Changing the template will complete the editor with the default code from the new template (only if you haven't yet applied changes in the editor pane). 

See [Templates](https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/wiki/Introduction#templates) for more information OLy's template-based concept. 

### Edit
Clicking this button opens a simple text editor that lets you modify the selected template or create a new one. Attention: Changes will affect every document on your system that uses this template, so be careful!
